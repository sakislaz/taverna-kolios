# Taverna Kolios - Blueprint

## Overview

A simple and intuitive interface for Taverna Kolios, a restaurant by the beach. The application will allow users to book tables, order food, and engage with other services offered by the taverna.

## Implemented Features

### Initial Setup

- **Home Page**: A visually appealing home page with a clear title and a grid of buttons for primary actions.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for a modern and responsive design.

## Current Plan

- **Resolve Git Authentication Issue**: The user is the owner of the repository but is unable to push changes. The current plan is to authenticate the local Git environment with the correct GitHub account.
